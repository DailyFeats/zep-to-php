ZEPHIR to PHP Translator
========================

This project implements a [ZEP](http://zephir-lang.com/) to [PHP](https://www.php.net/) translator.

The initial goal of this project, was to be able to create a PHP Version of [PHALCON](https://phalconphp.com), so that I could debug and discover, in depth, the workings of PHALCON.

This project, combined with the [PHALCON Debug Extension](https://github.com/test-to-com/phalcondbg) project has allowed me to finally Xdebug PHALCON.
